  <p>
    This document describes the terms and conditions governing your use of our digital services, including, but not limited to, dailyUV.com and our mobile applications, offered by Subtext Media Ltd (“us” or “we”).
  </p>
  <p>
    By accessing our servers, websites, mobile sites and applications or content therefrom (together, "dailyUV"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("TOS").  We may change, add, or remove portions of the TOS in future.  These changes will be effective immediately upon posting here. It is your responsibility to review these changes before continuing to use the site because continued use of the site indicates acceptance by you of the TOS then in effect.  We will try to notify users of TOS changes on the dailyUV homepage, but are not obligated to do so.

    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You agree:
    </p><ol>
    <li>
      any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim") arising out of or related to the TOS or your dailyUV use is governed by Vermont ("VT") law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle;
    </li>
    <li>
      Claims must be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in VT (except we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere);
    </li>
    <li>
      to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts;
    </li>
    <li>
      any Claim must be filed within one year after it arose or be forever barred;

    <li>
      not to bring or take part in a class action against dailyUV Entities;

    </li>
    <li>
      you are liable for TOS breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and
    </li>
    <li>
      to pay us for breaching or inducing others to breach the "USAGE" section, not as a penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post, email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected, and $1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.
    </li>
